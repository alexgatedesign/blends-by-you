Blends by You Co. - Website Package
===================================

This is a simple, responsive one-page website (clean & minimal) for Blends by You Co.

Files included:
 - index.html
 - styles.css
 - script.js
 - assets/juice-pitcher.png (placeholder - optional)
 - README.txt

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html in your browser to preview.
2. Replace placeholder images in the 'assets' folder with your real photos (keep filenames or update index.html).
3. Edit contact details (phone, email, address) directly in index.html.
4. To publish for free using GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new GitHub repo (public).
   - Upload all files to the repo's root.
   - In repo Settings > Pages, select branch 'main' and root folder. Save.
   - Visit https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name> after a few minutes.

Optional enhancements I can help implement:
